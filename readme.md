## CLI commands:
```bash
git clone <clone-address> #copy a repo to work on your local machine
git fetch #update local branch list
git branch #view branches and current branch
git checkout lab-a #switch working branch
git add -A #add changes to commit
git commit -m "commit message" #commit with a meaningful message
git push --set-upstream lab-a #push the commit to the relevant branch
```
